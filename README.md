# Copper-Phosphide Electrodeposition — Transient Analysis (Supporting Notebook)

This repository provides a reproducible Jupyter notebook and two small sample datasets that **replicate the transient-analysis workflow** used to study the electrochemical formation of copper phosphide from aqueous Cu(II) + hypophosphite (H2PO2-) solutions.  
The analysis relies on **analytical expressions of current transients** and the **solution of transcendental equations** to determine kinetic parameters.
